<h2> Week 01: Logistics Challenge - Alura Log </h2>

The manager of the logistics departmente at Alura log is facing some changes due to the increased demand caused by the corona virus pandemic. He wants to maintain service quality, so he needs to constantly monitor his department's metrics to make the best decisions. To help with this challenge, I created a dashboard for logistics with some important metrics for the area.

<h3> Database </h3>
The database provided by Alura log has the following .csv files:

<h4> tabela pedidos </h4>

<h4> tabela produtos </h4>
Contains the record of products and their values.

<h4> tabela ve√≠culos </h4>
